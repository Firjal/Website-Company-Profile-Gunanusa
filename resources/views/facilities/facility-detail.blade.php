                <h5 class="fw-semibold text-warning mb-3">Jetty üö¢</h5>
                <p>
                    There are 2 (two) jetties used for the load-out of structures and most of the offloading and loading of material. The jetty-1 has a bulkhead of 106m (length) x 15m (width) and a minimum water depth of (-) 7.5m from chart datum. The jetty-2 has a bulkhead of 80m (length) x 15m (width) and a minimum water depth of (-) 7m from the chart datum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The jetties were designed for a distribution load of 500T/m for the 1st of 4m from the jetty tip, 400T/m for the 2nd of 4m, 350T/m for the 3rd of 5m, and 250T/m along the skidway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The minimum water depth at the load-out jetty is (-) 7 up to (-) 7.5m from the chart datum and is at least this depth through natural channels leading to the open sea. There is no problem (obstructions, overhead clearance, bends, channel widths, or water depths) in bringing with it the structures from the fabrication yard.

                <p>
                    The skidways were designed for the skidding load-out method with the skidway spacing of 12.19m/20m at jetty-1 and 15.2m at jetty-2. The bulkhead was built at the jetty tip to allow for loading/unloading activity with the capacity for bearing loads up to 25 Tons/m2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skidways are 1.2m (width) x 1.5m (depth) embedded, spaced at 12.19m & 20.00m (skid-way jetty-1) and 15.35m (skid-way jetty-2) center to center. The length of skid-way jetty-1 is 300m and 153m for jetty-2 and both jetties face the open sea. Along the skidways, there are electrical outlets for 380 V rectifier-welding machines and compressed air outlets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The structure/modules can be fabricated in the skidway up to 100m in length and for weighing the structure up to 15.000Te.
                    <br>
                    Besides the skid-way system, the multi-wheel method and the lifting method are also possible to use for the load-out system at GUNANUSA Fabrication Yard.
